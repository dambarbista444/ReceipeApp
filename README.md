RecipeApp created using SwiftUI framework and swift programming language,
the purpose of the app is get the information about how to make various types of meals, the app provides instructions and ingredients. 

1. Had to make changes multiple times to handle ingredients and measures due to confusion with data structure, finally came up with better dynamic solution when i was drinking coffee next day and wandering what if ingredients and measures are more then 20.
